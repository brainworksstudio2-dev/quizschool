# **App Name**: QuizWhiz

## Core Features:

- Quiz Generation: Teachers can create quizzes by selecting a subject, week, topic, and number of questions. A tool shuffles questions randomly from the question bank, ensuring unique quizzes for each student.
- Quiz Taking: Students can take quizzes one at a time, with randomized questions shuffled specifically for them.
- Timer Functionality: Each quiz includes a timer, automatically submitting the quiz upon expiration.
- Curriculum Structure: The platform organizes quiz questions based on the curriculum structure of subjects, weeks, and topics (HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Git, JavaScript, Data Structures & Algorithms, React, Firebase, React Native, and Node.js).
- Tab Restriction: Restrict students from switching tabs during a quiz. This can be implemented by checking the document's visibility state. This requires the user's explicit permission, and it won't work if the user disables JavaScript, but should still suffice for an MVP.
